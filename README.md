Hello. My name is Alexander. I am Frontend javascript developer (React.js) with some Node.js background. I'm ready for relocation or remote work as Frontend developer.

I create websites and services for my clients during more than 7 years as fullstack developer. My experience in JavaScript with React / Redux is 3 years, HTML and CSS – 7 years.

I’m able to set deadlines on my own and comply with them. I’m constantly learning and create my own projects to enhance new knowledge. I can work with feedback and analyze code reviews to improve my skills.

I started the commercial development in 2013, on the date of foundation my own company. It is a medical cosmetology center. Then in few month later, I needed a website development. I tried to find someone who can help me with it, but I found nobody. And I started learning web development for myself. I created my first website on PHP for my medical center and it is the same nowadays.

Then I understood that I like development so much and begin trying hard to learn deeper in it. I’m studied the Harvard Extension School, Yandex school of user interfaces development an Facebook mobile dev school.
